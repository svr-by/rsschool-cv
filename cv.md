## About me
I am an engineer by education and by vocation. I have enjoyed writing code since high school. Unfortunately I haven't been working in a IT field yet. But I have gained invaluable experience in business, procurement, logistics and marketing. Undoubtedly, these skills will help me in my future career. I am attentive to details, assiduous, executive and easily trained.
